# Problem Manager

This is my personal collection of tools I use for competitive programming.
Take a look around and see if you can find something useful!

## Install

Run the install script (`install.ps1` or `install.sh` depending on your platform) to install the tools to your path for global use.
Keep in mind that you may need to use elevated permissions to install the tools.

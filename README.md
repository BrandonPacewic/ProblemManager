# Problem Manager

This is my personal collection of tools I use for competitive programming.
Take a look around and see if you can find something useful!

## Install

Run the `install.ps1` script to install the tools to your path for global use.
Keep in mind that you may need to use elevated permissions to install the tools.

Note: This is a windows specific script and will not work on other platforms.
